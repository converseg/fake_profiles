# Fake Browsing History

We have 5 fake profiles who each have a distinct and niche interest (see https://trackthis.link). After browsing for a while and building up a history (which includes searching for new homes and mortgage loans), we want to observe the loan-related ads presented to each profile. Are they targeted at their specific interests? 

Using: Python, Selenium

At test-time (after browsing history has been build up):
- Win --> Run --> path\_to\_ff\_installation -p --> select profile --> manually browse, observe ads
